                            <p>Developed a pricing regression model to estimate Boston Airbnb listing prices. Used web scraping, APIs, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to engineer features. Implemented a recommender system using cosine similarity to suggest listings based on user inputs. The pricing model outperformed the null model by reducing the root mean squared error from $86 to $49 and achieved an R-Squared value of 0.68 on validation data with outliers removed.</p>

                            <p>Built image classification models employing both convolutional and pre-trained neural network models to classify the severity of Alzheimerâs disease in MRI images. The model achieved an accuracy of 71% across four severity classes and improved upon the null model accuracy of 50%.  A second binary classification model was developed to focus on detecting very early stages of dementia by training on only two severity classes.  The binary model achieved an accuracy of 81%, an improvement of 22% over the null model accuracy of 59%.</p>

                                <li>
                                    Co-coordinated and managed the Draper Hardware Directorate 2019 Summer Intern Program, where 14 students competing in two teams were tasked to build self-navigating hovercraft vehicles capable of acquiring and impacting a stationary target. Developed the project technical concept and competition rules to teach real-world technical and administrative engineering skills. Performed student exit interviews to collect program feedback and participated in intern reviews to identify top performers as candidates for future employment opportunities and hiring decisions. Provided mentoring and administrative/technical guidance, and connected students with internal technical experts/mentors.
